'   NumericalDeriv
'
'   A very basic numerical derivative subroutine that looks at the instantaneous
'   slope between one or more points.  For sets of points > 2, the function
'   uses a linear least squares algorithm to get the slope of that point set
'
'   Inputs:
'           RMS_Array() - an N x M array where the first dimension contains
'                         N data points to be numerically differentiated
'                         and the second dimension can be used for additional
'                         N - point data sets.
'           Windows()   - a M x 1 vector containing the "window" size = the number
'                         of points over which to determine the slope / derivative
'                         of the data.
'
'   Outputs:
'         Deriv_Array() - an N x M array with the numerical derivative results for
'                         the M N-point datasets inputed by the user in RMS_Array

'Four Parameter Sine Fit algorithm
'Fits sine wave with an unknown but guessed freq,

'
'Adapted from MatLab code for IEEE Std 1057 sine fit algorithm
'By:    Isaac Hilburn, Jan. 2010
'
'Inputs:
'   Y_in()          - N x 1 vector of data values to be fit
'   T()             - N x 1 vector of corresponding time values for each element of Y_in()
'   N               - Number of data points, size of Y_in() and T()
'   TimeStep        - Assumes a constant step in time between each element in T()
'                       this time step is used later to scale the Delta-w of each iteration
'                       and determine if another fit iteration should be run.
'   w               - First estimate of the frequency of the sine data
'                       This first guess if it is very far off from the correct frequency
'                       (> 1 - 2 %) can cause the 4 parameter fit to be unstable
'   TOL             - If abs(Old Convergence Factors - New Convergence Factors) > TOL, then
'                     the 4-parameter fit updates w (w_i = w_i-1 + Delta-w) and does another
'                     iteration of the 4-parameter fit
'   Max_Iter        - Maximum number of fit iterations for each function call of SineFit4Param
'
'
'Output:
'   ConvFactors()   - 4 x 1 vector:
'                       {A0, B0, Y-Offset, Delta-w}
'                      4 elements that uniquely describe the sine fit to the data
'                     where Y_fit = Y-offset + A0 * cos( w * T ) + B0 * sine( w * T )
'                     The fourth element, Delta-w, is used by update the new estimate

'                       iterations values of A0, B0 and Y-Offset are also used in the
