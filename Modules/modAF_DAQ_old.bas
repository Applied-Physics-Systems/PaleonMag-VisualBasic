'   NumericalDeriv
'
'   A very basic numerical derivative subroutine that looks at the instantaneous
'   slope between one or more points.  For sets of points > 2, the function
'   uses a linear least squares algorithm to get the slope of that point set
'
'   Inputs:
'           RMS_Array() - an N x M array where the first dimension contains
'                         N data points to be numerically differentiated
'                         and the second dimension can be used for additional
'                         N - point data sets.
'           Windows()   - a M x 1 vector containing the "window" size = the number
'                         of points over which to determine the slope / derivative
'                         of the data.
'
'   Outputs:
'         Deriv_Array() - an N x M array with the numerical derivative results for
'                         the M N-point datasets inputed by the user in RMS_Array

'  Instead, the ADBasic code continues to ramp the output voltage up if it looks like it's possible to reach

'

'       For real-valued input, the imag half will contain zero values
