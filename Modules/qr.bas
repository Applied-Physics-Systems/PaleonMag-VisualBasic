'QR decomposition of a rectangular matrix of size MxN
'
'Input parameters:
'    A   -   matrix A whose indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..N-1].
'    M   -   number of rows in matrix A.
'    N   -   number of columns in matrix A.
'
'Output parameters:
'    A   -   matrices Q and R in compact form (see below).
'    Tau -   array of scalar factors which are used to form
'            matrix Q. Array whose index ranges within [0.. Min(M-1,N-1)].
'
'Matrix A is represented as A = QR, where Q is an orthogonal matrix of size
'MxM, R - upper triangular (or upper trapezoid) matrix of size M x N.
'
'The elements of matrix R are located on and above the main diagonal of
'matrix A. The elements which are located in Tau array and below the main
'diagonal of matrix A are used to form matrix Q as follows:
'
'Matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflections
'
'Q = H(0)*H(2)*...*H(k-1),
'
'where k = min(m,n), and each H(i) is in the form
'
'H(i) = 1 - tau * v * (v^T)
'
'where tau is a scalar stored in Tau[I]; v - real vector,
'so that v(0:i-1) = 0, v(i) = 1, v(i+1:m-1) stored in A(i+1:m-1,i).
